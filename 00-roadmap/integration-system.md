## Appendix: Mental Health & Sustainability

### Warning Signs to Watch For

**Burnout Indicators**:
- [ ] Consistently working 7 days/week
- [ ] Skipping meals or poor nutrition
- [ ] Sleep < 6 hours regularly
- [ ] Irritability or mood swings
- [ ] Physical symptoms (headaches, fatigue)
- [ ] Loss of enthusiasm for learning
- [ ] Avoidance of social connections
- [ ] Perfectionism preventing progress

**If you notice 3+ indicators**: Take a mandatory rest day immediately.

### Sustainability Practices

**Daily Non-Negotiables**:
- 7+ hours of sleep
- 3 proper meals

- 15 minutes outdoors
- Social contact (even brief)

**Weekly Non-Negotiables**:
- 1 full rest day (Sunday)
- 1 social activity

### When to Adjust the Plan

**Acceptable Reasons to Slow Down**:
- Consistent signs of burnout
- Physical health issues
- Family emergencies
- Mental health struggles
- Learning plateau (need integration time)

**How to Adjust Without Quitting**:
1. Reduce daily hours, not daily consistency
2. Focus on one domain instead of parallel learning
3. Extend timeline rather than lowering quality
4. Prioritize hands-on projects over passive study
5. Communicate with partner about adjustment
